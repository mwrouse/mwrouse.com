As a freshman in college I seemed to have trouble locking my keys in my room.<p></p><p>Because of this, I feared that I would do it late at night when the front desk would be closed and I wouldn't be able to get my spare key.</p><p>The solution to my problem was with my Arduino, a keypad from eBay, and a servo motor.

<p>I created one of the most talked about things on my floor, my keypad door lock.</p><p>I'm going to include images and the code I used below, please beware that it is in no way a pretty sight, and is a mess of cables.</p><p>I've been meaning to put it in a project box for a permanent and moveable system, but have not gotten around to it.</p><p>I apologize for not having a diagram.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/mwrouse/ArduinoKeypad" target="_blank">View Code on Github</a></p><p>
