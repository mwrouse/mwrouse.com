I have recently been messing around with the <a href="http://d-mp.org">Dark Multiplayer</a> mod for Kerbal Space Program and it's a blast being able to play KSP with my friends, flying rockets/planes at one another.
<p>
And of course other mischievous things that Kerbal Space Program makes possible.
</p><p>
My only complaint is the icon on the server file is absolutely drab; just a generic "program" icon. It's ugly.
</p><p>
So I took this matter into my own hands, and created an icon that I feel represents it perfectly.
<!-- more -->

<h2>The Result</h2>

I'm actually happy with the result that I got, I just took the standard Kerbal Space Program icon, and added two more Kerbonauts to the icon,
<code>multiplayer</code>.
</p>
<p>I like it because it's easy to tell the difference between the shortcut to the server, and the shortcut to Kerbal Space Program that sit on my desktop.
</p><p>
Even if the labels are different, I think an icon definitely helps, and beats the default icon ten-fold.
