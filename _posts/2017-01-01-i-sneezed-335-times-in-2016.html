<p>After seeing someone on <code class="highlighter-rouge">/r/InternetIsBeautiful</code> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/3nhjiy/guy_keeps_record_of_his_sneezes_since_2007/">post a link to a blog that someone used to track their sneezes</a>, I decided to track my sneezes over 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That was late December 2015. I quickly create a basic website that I could access from anywhere that would quickly log sneezed into a database, saving the month, day, and timestamp along with it.

<p>Through 2016, I can recall two times that I was not with my phone when I sneezed. One time I simply borrowed a friend’s phone while sitting at Sonic waiting for half-priced shakes. The other, I marked the back of my hand with a tally mark so I would not forget.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Below are some charts I made using the data gathered over the year.

<p>Here is the month of August, wehn I sneezed the most:

<p></p>
<p>Then Monday March 28<sup>th</sup>, the day I sneezed the most (8 total):

<p>Now, graphs that show each individual sneeze:

(I apologize for the sudden change in coloring on the charts…)</p>

<p>Going into 2016, I didn’t know what to expect. Now, looking back, I think 335 is a reasonable number, seeing as I do not suffer from allergies. Let’s have some fun with this though:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I only sneezed 216 days out of the year, leaving 149 days that I did not sneeze.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Assuming the average sneeze takes 10 seconds (build up, sneeze, and recovery), then I spent 55.83 minutes of 2016 sneezing… Not including sneezes that had a build up but never happened (I will be tracking these in 2017 along with sneezes).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While 55.83 minutes might seem like a lot, it is only 0.12% of the entire year. A year well spent, I’d say.</p>
