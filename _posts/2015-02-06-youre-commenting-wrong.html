The one thing that I have never stopped hearing in my programming classes, even upper level ones, is something along the lines of:
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I was adding comments to my program…</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Countless numbers of the people I have helped with programming do not add comments while they’re actually writing the code.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, for some reason, they have learned that going back through your program and adding comments once it’s done, is <em>acceptable</em>.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-acceptable">It’s Not Acceptable</h2>
<p>Sure, you’re little 20-line program might be understandable to you after you write the code. Hell, it might even be understandable if you go back through it in a year.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But that is still no excuse for such a bad habit.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What happens when you’re writing a several hundred line program? And even after a day, you hardly can remember what a section of code does? Or even worse, working with a team of people who are programming the same thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="add-comments-while-writing-code">Add Comments While Writing Code</h2>
<p>I’m not sure if this bad habit has been caused by the teacher’s neglect for enforcing good program comments, or if it’s just students being lazy.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But, if you want to be a successful programmer, or even an intermediate one, you need to add comments while writing your programs!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>It doesn’t take long</strong>, in fact it might even say you the time you take trying to re-understand your program after you have finished.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">A comment now will save you later!</code>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="stupid-comments-dont-exist">Stupid Comments Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>Hopefully now that I’ve persuaded you (I know, I didn’t try very hard) to start adding comments while you write your code, I can tell you that there is no such thing as a stupid comment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The same goes for a redundant comment, they don’t exist, every comment in your program is helpful, and there for a reason.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you feel that you might not remember what a variable is for (especially variables used in equations), then add a comment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What you <em>might</em> forget, someone else <em>will</em> forget.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="write-meaningful-comments">Write Meaningful Comments</h2>
<p>So, I know I said that there is no such thing as a stupid/redundant comment, I actually lied about that.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If your comments are not <em>meaningful</em>, like your variable names, then they’re stupid, worthless, and need to be changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That means, <strong>do not</strong> do this:</p>
<p></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
int x; // Integer x
</code></pre>
<p>Like, really? No shit.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, try something like:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
int x; // Distance between variable y and variable z
</code></pre>
<p>This comment tells us a whole lot more, now we actually know what the variable x represents, and how we can calculate the value.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, remember that meaningful variable names (along with comments) are crucial to writing nice and easy to read code, so instead of calling the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>, try:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
int distance; // Distance between variable y and variable z
</code></pre>
<p>Or something similar, that gives more meaning to the variable.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
