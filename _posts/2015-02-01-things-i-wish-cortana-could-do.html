description: Cortana has continuously grown since her original release in Windows Phone 8.1. But here are some things that I think she could improve by doing.

If any of you know me then you should also know that I love Windows Phone. I have been using it for a couple years now and I'm absolutely in love with the platform.

<p>I wouldn't trade my Windows Phone for anything.</p>

<p>And the same goes for Cortana, she has learned about me, and improved my schedule ten-fold since she was released. She is incredibly powerful and continues to grow every day, but there are still some basic things that I think she should be able to do.

<h2 id="one-time-use-alarms">One-Time Use Alarms</h2>
<p>One of the most useful features that I use on a daily basis is Cortana's ability to create a alarms whenever you tell her something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wake me up in 35 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This command will create an alarm to go off in the x amount of time you specified.</p>

<p>The thing that I really wish would happen is these alarms would <em>auto-delete</em> themselves after you dismiss them.</p>

<p>Since these alarms are set as a one-time use, they will only go off once and then just sit there unused until you manually delete them.</p>

<p>I think that having these auto-delete would be more like having an actual personal assistance because you don't have to manually remove the alarms.</p>

<p>And a personalized message from Cortana would be cool too. Something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's time to wake up, Michael.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or for a reminder event:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's time to change your laundry, Michael.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe she could even say the message (along with the toast) and then play the alarm music.</p>

<p>But, that would just be a plus, I still I think it's pretty simple for the alarms to automatically remove themselves. Having to go back through and remove my one-time use alarms is incredibly <em>annoying</em>.</p>

<h2 id="reminderevent-title-manipulation">Reminder/Event Title Manipulation</h2>
<p>This goes right alongside the reminders I just discussed.</p>

<p>If I were to tell Cortana:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remind me tomorrow at three pm to call my mother.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She would create an event for me tomorrow at 3pm with the title "<code class="highlighter-rouge">Call my mother.</code>"</p>

<p>While this isn't a huge issue, I would still really like this to feel more like an actual assistant by creating a calendar event called "<code class="highlighter-rouge">Call your mother.</code>" and learn to manipulate the titles to change any "my"s into yours.</p>
