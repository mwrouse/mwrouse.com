My time as an Intern at <a href="https://knowledgelake.com" target="_blank">KnowledgeLake</a> consists of three summers, and two school years of remote work.
<br/>
The work done here, on Enterprise Content Management software,  is web front end work with a heavy C# backend.
<br/><br/>
During my first internship I was thrusted into this world and set out to create an entirely new
part of the overall application.
This project, called "Upload", allows user to upload documents through a web interface and have them enter the system.
<br/><br/>
My second summer I worked on a new security and authentication system that the product now uses. Along with this,
I also <i>painfully</i> developed Office Add-Ins for our product. These add-ins leveraged the Upload App (first internship project),
and allows users to upload documents/emails/attachments directly from any Microsoft Office program.
<br/><br/>
After my second summer I continued to work remotely through the school year. During this time, and the next summer, I was tasked with bugfixes involving
my previous creations, as well as working on other bugs throughout the software.
