The goal of the Drillbotics Team is to design and build a fully autonomous drilling rig that can drill through a rock.
<br/>
This year, teams had to drill through a homogenous sandstone block and deviate to exit through the side of the rock.
A very, very challenging task. Previous years had only been to drill straight down.
<br/><br/>
The electrical system for the drill was in disarray when I became Electrical Lead. The first thing
I wanted to accomplish was to get rid of the ratsnest of wires in the primary control box.
<br/>
This was accomplished by using custom circuit boards to eliminate the majority of the wiring. Circuit boards communicated
over a CAN Bus and were fully generic, they could be added and removed as needed.

By the middle of the Spring Semester the team and I had accomplished something that the team had never done before: <b>Autonomous Drilling!</b>

This accomplishment was a huge milestone for our team.

Unfortunately, despite our teams' internal success, we did not place at the competition. Our design for deviated drilling
was a little primitive and did not work as well as we hoped.
<br/>
I could not be more proud of what this team and I accomplished during that year.
