During my first few years on the <a href="https://solarcar.mst.edu" target="_blank">Missouri S&amp;T Solar Car Team</a> my role dealt
mainly with the telemetry software, the team website, and programming microcontrollers.

The telemetry software received UDP messages sent from the solar car, updated the interface, and logged to a text file.
<br/>
After the initial rewrite, the code behind this interface went through many changes.
<br/>
In 2016, the team placed 4<sup>th</sup> in the American Solar Challenge.

During the second year racing Solar Miner, at the 2017 Formula Sun Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, I was responsible
for the maintenance of the Battery Protection System software.

This race was challenging and our team faced a lot of problems, but we powered through each problem, overcame shorting
the battery pack, and finished 8<sup>th</sup> out of 17 teams.
