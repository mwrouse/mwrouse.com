My time as the sole developer at LMI Aerospace Inc. in Cuba, MO was an unforgettable good experience.
<br/>
In the fall semester of 2016, I responded to an email-blast about an internship in Cuba, MO as a programmer.
The reason behind the internship was to update the plant's custom work order processing system.
<br/>
The system, a web-based application built using ASP.NET with some C# backend, tracked orders through the plant.
It allowed management to track wherever an order was at any certain time.
<br/>
In my time here, I added several features to this system, and performed several minor bug fixes I found
along the way.
<br/>
My main goal for the internship was to add time-tracking to each order. This included a countdown to when the
part should be in the next location, and a countdown to when the part should leave.
<br/>
This was used to enforce time frames for certain areas of the plant, as well as checking on
how long expedited orders are doing.
