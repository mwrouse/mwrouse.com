In the fall semester of 2017, I started my role as the Electrical Team Lead for the <a href="https://solarcar.mst.edu" target="_blank">Missouri S&amp;T Solar Car Team</a>.
This was a big step up from my previous roles in the team, but I was feeling up to the challenge after
having a frustrating time at FSGP 2017.
<br/>
My primary goals were to increase the efficiency of the electrical team. While we were unable to race due
to BPS issues (actual electrical magic), ridiculous roadblocks put up by the school, and poor team morale, I believe I accomplished
my goal. I ended up designing several non-complex circuit boards, and wrote a ton of software.

I created several tools for the electrical team that increases efficiency when writing code, designing boards, and purchasing components.
<br/><br/>
The first, which I had already been working on for almost a year at the start of the school year, was a Driver Library written in C.
This library, complete with unit tests, allows us to write less common code (e.g., CAN Drivers, SPI Drivers) and gives us a piece of mind of knowing that it works.
<br/>
At the time, we used Texas Instruments MSP430F5529 microcontrollers, so I wanted this library to provide an Arduino-like syntax but still be robust
enough to support different microcontrollers (and different CAN controllers) with different features and specs.
<br/>
The driver library ended up being completely modular. The microcontroller and CAN controller drivers are both selected at runtime
based on preprocessor directives set by the compiler (or IDE). This is what I am most proud of on my time with the team.
<br/><br/>
My <a href="https://github.com/mst-solar-car/kicad-bom-generator" target="_blank">KiCad BOM Generator</a> was created to reduce the amount of time it takes team members to produce Bill-of-Materials for their projects, and to encforce a common formatting.
<br/>
It is highly customizable and fully-featured, I'm also really proud of this.
<br/><br/>
I also created a common library of KiCad components (symbols and footprints) for the majority of components we use on the team. This is complete with metadata for each component
including suplier and manufacturer information. The goal of this was to reduce the amount of time to design boards, as well as reduce errors in footprints since
team members no longer need to be making the same footprints as other members.
