A portable static website generator designed to be similar to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.<br/>
Designed to be a learning experience as one of my first parsers, it quickly grew into a <i>somewhat</i> complete tool.<br/>
Not nearly as intricate as Jekyll, but it is used to produce this website.<br/>
