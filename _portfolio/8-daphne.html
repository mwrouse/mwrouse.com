Daphne is a portable static website generator designed to be similar to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" class="accent">Jekyll</a>.<br/>
Designed to be a learning experience as one of my first parsers, it quickly grew into a somewhat complete tool.<br/>
Not nearly as intricate as Jekyll, but it was used to produce this website.
